Returns these integers as a tuple.
Function operation(numbers, choice):
Performs an arithmetic operation based on choice: addition (1), subtraction (2), multiplication (3), or division (4).
Outputs and returns the result of the operation.
Get Numbers: numbers = num() retrieves two numbers from the user.
Get Operation Choice: choice = int(input(...)) prompts the user to choose an operation.
Perform Operation: operate = operation(numbers, choice) computes the result based on the chosen operation.
Thank You Message: print("THANK YOU FOR USING MY CALCULATOR.") thanks the user.
This code implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
